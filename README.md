# Znajdź Zastępstwo

If a counselor cannot attend a court hearing, he still has to represent his client during the proceedigns. This is where substitute lawyers come in handy - they may attend a hearing in place of the main counselor. Znajdź Zastępstwo is a website for finding substitute lawyers all over Poland.

It's a final project for a CodersLab Front-End: React Bootcamp.
